## Introduction/Background

According to the CDC [1], heart failure is the leading cause of death in the world, affecting over 600,000 people in the U.S. alone. There are more than a handful of machine learning models [2], [3], such as K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Ridge Classifier, that have been applied to predict heart failure by utilizing inputted clinical features. These features can include age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The provided datasets contain comprehensive statistics of clinical factors relating to the risk of heart failure:
1. **[Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) by fedesoriano:**
   - Features: Common event features caused by CVDs
2. **[Heart Failure Clinical Records](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nimapourmoradi/heart-failure-clinical-records) by Nima Pourmoradi:**
   - Features: Clinical records specific to heart failure
3. **[Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) by KAMIL PYTLAK:**
   - Features: Data collected from CDC, including all the major risk factors for heart failure

## Problem/Motivation

Despite significant advances in medical technology, accurately predicting heart failure remains a challenging task. Many existing models are not generalizable across different patient populations and often fail to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers. The complexity and variability of human physiology necessitate more sophisticated predictive models that can handle diverse and high-dimensional data. For instance, several research papers like [4] have identified various factors, including environmental, genetic, and lifestyle factors, that are correlated with heart failure risk, underscoring the need for improved predictive models that effectively capture and embody the relationships among them. Such models are crucial for identifying high-risk patients earlier and more accurately in a wider range of scope, enhancing treatment plans and reducing mortality rates. Leveraging machine learning models can provide robust, reliable predictions in clinical settings.

## Data Cleaning

Our group decided to utilize the first dataset we found from Kaggle, the _Heart Failure Prediction Dataset_. The dataset contained some missing values and inconsistencies that needed to be addressed before we could proceed with our analysis. Here, we describe the steps we took to clean the dataset and provide a comparison of the dataset before and after cleaning.

**Cleaning Proces: Handling Missing Values**:
   - We identified that the dataset had several missing values, particularly in the `RestingBP` and `Cholesterol` columns. These missing values were addressed by removing rows with zero values in these columns to ensure the accuracy and integrity of our data.

**After Cleaning**

As illustrated, the data cleaning process significantly improved the dataset quality, making it more suitable for subsequent analysis and modeling.

## Methods Planning on Implementation
1. **Supervised Methods:**
   - **Random Forest Classification (sklearn):** COMPLETED
   - **KNN (scikit-learn)** for simple predictions based on similarity and visualization of the data.
   - **Neural Networks (pytorch)** for handling high-dimensional data with deep learning techniques for flexibility.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA** to simplify data and remove redundant features.
   - **Fill in missing data (pandas)** COMPLETED
   - **Extracting Important Features (pandas):** to ensure data integration.

## 1st Supervised Method: Random Forest Model ##

In our study, we utilized the Random Forest classifier to predict heart failure based on the cleaned dataset.

1. Loading the Dataset: We loaded the cleaned dataset and checked the data types to ensure proper conversion of string data to appropriate types.

2. Handling Categorical Variables: We used label encoding for categorical variables, as it is suitable for tree-based algorithms like Random Forest.

3. Scaling Features: Numerical features were scaled to standardize the data, which helps in improving model performance and stability.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

We used Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to estimate the performance of our model. 

1. K-fold cross-validation :
- We divide the samples and the associated targets into ùëò distinct sets, ensuring that each set is exclusive of the others. This process is known as k-fold cross-validation.
- Using KFold from scikit-learn, we can split any dataset into ùëò equal parts. Each sample is assigned a value from 0 to ùëò ‚àí 1, ensuring that each subset is used for both training and validation in different iterations.

2. Stratified k-fold cross-validation :
- For skewed datasets, such as those with 90% positive and 10% negative samples, using simple k-fold cross-validation can result in folds with only negative samples.
- In such cases, stratified k-fold cross-validation is preferred. This method ensures that the ratio of labels (e.g., 90% positive and 10% negative) remains consistent in each fold.
- By maintaining this ratio, stratified k-fold cross-validation provides more reliable and consistent evaluation metrics across all folds, regardless of the metric chosen.

   **OUTPUT**
  
   Cross-Validation ROC-AUC Scores: [0.93936966 0.93418202 0.92759119 0.93625858 0.90790899]
  
   Mean ROC-AUC Score: 0.929062086192368
<br>

**Random Forest Model**
1. Build new data set from original data : randomly select the data while keeping the same number of rows with the original data set.
2. While we don't use all the features for training the trees, we randomly select subset of features and use only those selected for training.
3. The prediction is done by passing in a new data for all the trees generated, and choosing the majority voting.

**Visualization**

We also visualized the relationship between the number of trees in the Random Forest model and the model's accuracy:
