# CS4641 Group 5 Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models for analyzing and predicting heart-related health outcomes. 
The project is structured into various directories for data preprocessing, analysis, and implementation of both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Directory Structure
- **Data**: Contains raw and preprocessed datasets.
- **DataAnalysis**: Scripts and notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- **GitHub_Pages**: Resources for the project's GitHub Pages site.
- **Preprocessing**: Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **SupervisedLearning**: Implementation of supervised learning algorithms.
- **UnsupervisedLearning**: Implementation of unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunnypark12/cs4641_group5.git
   cd cs4641_group5

### Usage
**Data Preprocessing**
Navigate to the Preprocessing directory and run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.

**Data Analysis**
Explore the data using the notebooks and scripts in the DataAnalysis directory.

**Model Training**
Train and evaluate models using the scripts in the SupervisedLearning and UnsupervisedLearning directories.
